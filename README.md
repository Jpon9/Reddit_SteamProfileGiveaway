##Reddit SteamUrlGrabber

This script grabs all unique Steam profile links from a Reddit submission thread, gets the Steam Community IDs, and checks the account age before entering them into the giveaway and assigning them a prize.

###Usage Instructions

Feel free to modify the script in any way you see fit.  All you really need to do to get this up and running as-is is to create a settings.json file based on the settings.example.json file in the /Python directory and editing /Python/items.json which holds the items that are winnable and the quantity of each of those items.
